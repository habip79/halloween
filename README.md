Halloween Themed Website

This project is for <a href="https://w3schools.com/">W3Schools</a> Halloween Event held at <a href="https://discord.gg/w3schools">discord channel</a> in October 2022.<br>
This is not for commercial purposes.<br>
I used HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a little bit Javascript for this project.
It is a responsive and accessible web site.
